# Signal-Noise-Removal
 

 ## Key Features
* This project demonstrates the noise removal by using FFT analysis and Decrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
from a contaminated signal. 

* The code is shown in the in the [Code](https://github.com/yuchehuang/Signal-Noise-Removal/tree/master/code)  folder

* The result of the experiment is shown as the [report](https://github.com/yuchehuang/Signal-Noise-Removal/blob/master/Report.pdf)
